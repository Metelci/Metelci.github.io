# Metelci.github.io

An informative GitHub Pages portfolio that highlights Metelci’s learning-focused products, technical stack, and contact info.

## 🔍 What’s inside

- **Static site** built with semantic HTML, modern CSS, and a tiny sprinkle of vanilla JS for the mobile navigation.
- **Sections** for hero intro, about, featured projects, skills, impact highlights, and contact.
- **Accessible, responsive layout** with keyboard-friendly navigation and motion preferences respected.

## 🚀 Local preview

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Metelci/Metelci.github.io.git
cd Metelci.github.io

# Open index.html in your browser
# (e.g. double-click it, or use a lightweight static server like:)
npx serve
```

## 🛠 Customising

- Update copy, stats, and links directly in `index.html`.
- Tweak colours, spacing, or typography via CSS variables inside `styles.css`.
- Add screenshots or media to `assets/` and reference them from the relevant sections.
- Need additional sections? Duplicate an existing `.panel` block and adjust the content.

## 📄 Deployment

Because this is a user site (`username.github.io`), pushing to the `main` branch automatically publishes the latest version at <https://metelci.github.io>.
